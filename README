statnot CURVERSION - Status and Notifications

notification-deamon replacement intended to be used with lightweight 
window managers such as dwm or wmii
Receives D-Bus/Desktop Notifications (libnotify / notify-send)

*Note: this is an early version of statnot. It has only been tested with
a few libnotify enabled applications. PLEASE report any bugs.*


Installation
============
* edit config.mk to fit your setup

    # make install

statnot does not overwrite any existing notification daemon. However,
only one receiver of notifications can be active at one, so you need
to kill any running before starting statnot.

Example .xinitrc when using dwm:

    killall notification-daemon &> /dev/null
    statnot & 
    exec dwm

*Note: you should obviously disable any existing status update scripts*

When there is no notification message pending, statnot prints a regular
status line. By default ~/.statusline.sh is called, and stdout is printed.
Example .statusline.sh (prints `[load 0.27 0.15 0.10]   12:25`):

    loadavg="`cat /proc/loadavg | awk '{print $1, $2, $3}'`"
    echo "[load ${loadavg}]   `date +'%R'`"

*Note: make sure .statusline.sh is executable*

To test if it works (watch status bar):

    $ notify-send "Hello World"
    
Dependencies
------------
* python 2.5+ 
* python-notify


Configuration
=============
Configuration is a bit crude. Open the statnot executable - it's python -
and edit the settings beneath the CONFIGURATION marker.


Integration
===========
statnot should integrate nicely with libnotify enabled softare (please
report any bugs). If you want to send your own notifications from e.g.
scripts, try `notify-send`.

I use notify-send to display audio volume changes when I press my media
buttons. Obviously two presses in a row changes the volume two steps
and I don't want to wait for the first message to timeout before the 
new, actual message shows. Use `notify-send -t 0` if you want to change
this behaviour. In this case, the message will show for a regular tick of
status message updates or until another notification appears.

*Note: the trick above is a workaround. Proper applications implement the
replaces_id in the Desktop Notifications protocol.*


TODO
====
* Notification priority
* update_text functions for other WMs

Considering
-----------
* Is python OK or rewrite in e.g. C?
* Create configuration in a separate file?
* Proper integration with dbus (automatically started, etc)?
  Being able to try this out without permanently changing the 
  regular notification setup is nice.
