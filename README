statnot - Status and Notifications

Lightweight notification-(to-become)-deamon intended to be used
with lightweight WMs, like dwm.
Receives Desktop Notifications (including libnotify / notify-send)
See: http://www.galago-project.org/specs/notification/0.9/index.html

Note: VERY early prototype, to get feedback. Not close to done. Todo:
  * Proper integration with dbus (automatically started, etc)
  * Create update_texts for more applications / WMs
  * Make deamon
  * Testing, also with libnotify enabled apps
  * Packaging, documentation, ...
  * Figure out a decent name (!)

Instructions (for dwm, modify update_text below for other WMs)
  * Disable regular dwm status update (optional, but they will collide)
  * Disable notification-daemon. A regular 'kill' should do.
  * 'chmod +x stat.sh' or configure STATUS_COMMAND below
  * Start statnot ('python statnot')
  * Watch status message appear and update
  * Execute 'notify-send -t 500 Quick; notify-send Test' and watch
  * Ctrl+C to terminate statnot

Dependencies:
  * python 2.4+ (?)
  * python-notify

Things to think about / need comments:
  * How to manage quick, overriding messages cleanly, e.g. media
    button volume change? Is the current 0-time idea OK?
  * Can update_text be modified easily for other WMs?
  * Is calling a command and reading from stdout the preferred
    way of fetching status texts?
  * Is this a project worth doing at all?
  * Is python OK or rewrite in e.g. C?
  * Anything else?
